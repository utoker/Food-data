A website for getting nutrient profile data of requested food from USDA Food Database with Rest API.
I did this project to look up a food's nutrients in seconds without having to google it.

• Sourced data from the United States Department of Agriculture's Food Database via REST API by implementing Axios.
• Enabled server-side rendering by utilizing Next.js.
• Designed React components by implementing Chakra UI.
• Maintained up-to-date knowledge of current and emerging technologies, products, and trends related to the project.

## Built With

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - A React framework with hybrid static & server rendering
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) - A simple, modular and accessible component library for React
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) - Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js
